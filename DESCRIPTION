Package: LBSPR
Title: Length-Based Spawning Potential Ratio
Version: 0.1.3
Authors@R: person("Adrian", "Hordyk", email = "ar.hordyk@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Simulate expected equilibrium length composition, yield-per-recruit, and
    the spawning potential ratio (SPR) using the length-based SPR (LBSPR) model. Fit the LBSPR
    model to length data to estimate  selectivity, relative apical fishing mortality, and
    the spawning potential ratio for data-limited fisheries.
    See Hordyk et al (2016) <doi:10.1139/cjfas-2015-0422> for more information about the
    LBSPR assessment method.
